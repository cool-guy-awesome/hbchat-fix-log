# DO NOT TRY TO INTERACT WITH THE SERVER
The server is currently being exploited and most likely an attempted DDoS attack is occuring. Also, hbchat is dead.

There was a doxxing by a hacker named "Fleetway"

Do not trust him at any cost. He is a terrorist and a hacker.

Me and others are investigating. You are welcome to ask questions

I am working on a remake called Let's Chat along with Project Rose, so it won't have doxxing issues.

Take this advice and go on.
