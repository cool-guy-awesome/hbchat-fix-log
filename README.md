# This repo has come to an end.
I am working on a remake called Let's Chat that will be more secure, also, Fleetway (the doxxer) was arrested.

# what happened?
hbchat was great, until fleetway came along and doxxed a ton of people, there have been 4 home addresses exposed, and I am going to attempt to notify the victims of this.

# Is Let's Chat out yet?
No, and we have no ETA, but I'm thinking *maybe* early 2026. I really wish it could be a christmas release, however that might not be the case.

Feel free to look around here, the source code is not recommended to run, but you can if you want to I suppose, you'll just have to figure out how to.

I'd like to add that uh, Project Rose's (people I work with) servers got rm -rf --no-preserve-root-ed on 11/4/25. So Let's Chat might take a while longer.
